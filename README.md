# MiVeCC_with_DRL
This is a Multi-intersection Vehicular Cooperative Control (MiVeCC) scheme to enable cooperation among vehicles in a 3*3 unsignalized intersections. we proposed a algorithm combined heuristic-rule and two-stage deep reinforcement learning. The heuristic-rule achieves vehicles across the intersections without collisions. Based on the heuristic-rule, DDPG is used to optimize the collaborative control of vehicles and improve the traffic efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve travel efficiency at multiple intersections by up to 4.59 times without collision compared with existing methods.
